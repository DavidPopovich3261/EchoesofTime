            <p>
                The story of Atlantis was first told by the ancient Greek philosopher Plato around 360 B.C. 
                He described it as a powerful and advanced kingdom that sank, in a single day and night of misfortune, into the ocean.
                According to the texts, Atlantis was larger than Libya and Asia combined.
            </p>

            <blockquote>
                "Now in this island of Atlantis there was a great and wonderful empire which had rule over the whole island and several others."
                <br>— <cite>Plato, Timaeus</cite>
            </blockquote>

            <h3>The Divine Connection</h3>
            <p>
                Legend says the island was created by Poseidon, the god of the sea. 
                He carved the mountain where his love dwelt into a palace and enclosed it with three circular moats of increasing width, 
                separated by rings of land. The Atlanteans built bridges northward from the mountain, making a route to the rest of the island.

                <p>While we don't know for sure, some linguists theorize it might have been a precursor to Indo-European languages. However, in fiction, "Atlantean" is often depicted as a constructed language with unique symbols.</p>
